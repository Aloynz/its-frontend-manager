## Project 1 - Front-end Management System for ITS

### Overview

This project implements a front-end management system that provides ITS to real-world customers. It needs to have a nice UI and UX design, a robust database, and a flexible system framework. You need to think about how students and instructors will use ITS, and how they can be best benefited from ITS. The tasks in this project include:

- Analyze the stakeholderâ€™s (e.g., students and instructors) requirements on how they would like to interact with the ITS. Note that, in this project, you may need to regularly discuss with stakeholders.
- Design a framework of the management system that can generalize ITS to support various programming platforms. For example, Coursemology, SourceAcademy, LeetCode, etc.
- Design a database and think about how you can efficiently store necessary information.
- Deploy the framework in a mock-up environment and test it with a well-established testing strategy.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
